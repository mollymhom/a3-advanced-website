            <p>Arcane Society have updated the information on the <a href="#">Ilona Andrews Special Box</a>, containing exclusive hardcover editions of both <a href="#">Iron and Magic</a> and <a href="#">Blood Heir</a>.</p>
            <p>The books are expected to arrive from the printer and into the Arcane Society warehouse this Friday, April 19th. That means shipping to customers is estimated to begin next week. You can consult news directly on the <a href="#">Arcane Society updates page</a> or contact them for other enquiries at help@arcanesociety.com.</p>
            <p>For anyone who has missed out on the box this time, unfortunately these will not get reprinted. Once the stock is gone, that’s it. Arcane Society are a book subscription service, not commissioned by the authors for the special editions. They are their own independent business who are responsible for creative and commercial decisions, so unfortunately we cannot intercede to have the box reissued or shipped earlier. You can find out more about it on their About and FAQ pages.</p>
            <p>However, all is not lost! We will have the opportunity for more pretty books (so purty!) this year, when Subterranean Press release their second Innkeeper Chronicles volume, this time containing Sweep of the Blade, Sweep with Me and the Gerard Demille and Helen Meet short. I don’t have preorder links yet, but it is expected in the second half of the year.</p>
            <p>And we do have a sneaky peek at the signing sheets (interior pages made especially for the autograph of the author)</p>

            <p>I know everyone is busy and the world is falling apart, but could we get more Ilona book reviews for our self imposed isolation. I could use some escapism right now.</p>
            <p>This is going to be an off-brand recommendation. Usually, we try to recommend books that will appeal to people who read us. I haven’t read any of those lately. Gordon is reading an early Piers Anthony. The title is KIAI! (Jason Striker,) which is, according to him, a “martial arts men’s adventure. If they wrote a book to go along with Big Jim action figures from the 70’s, this would be that book.” Make of that what you will. He says the martial arts are very well written and there are ninjas at the end.</p>
            <p>I am also reading a martial arts book, but mine is more fantasy. I am on book 3 of this series, which for me is nothing short of a miracle.</p>
            <p>When beginning writers ask us about characterization, we usually try to explain that the character must be a product of their environment. Lindon is very much a product of his upbringing. He was weak and at the mercy of everyone, so to survive he develops an entirely different set of skills than his peers. He is forced to use his mind to keep on breathing, so he is smart. If he can cheat to win, he will. If he sees an opportunity to trick his opponent, he will take it. Despite being shunned, he is kind and compassionate, but most of all he is hungry to learn. He is starved for knowledge and when he finally finds a teacher, he excels in unexpected ways.</p>
            <p>The book has a merest hint of romance. He meets this badass girl, Yerin, who is terrifying, and he travels out of the valley. Most of it is about different types of madra and how to use them and different martial arts. As I said, I’m on book three and I love it. But it’s different from our work in tone, so it may not appeal to you. As always, try the sample first.</p>
